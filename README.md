Customer Segmentation with K-Means

🚀 Uncover valuable customer insights using K-Means clustering!

📌 Overview

This project applies K-Means clustering to segment customers based on demographic and behavioral data. Customer segmentation helps businesses understand different customer groups, improve marketing strategies, and optimize customer retention.

📊 Dataset
	•	The dataset used in this project is sourced from IBM Object Storage.
	•	It contains customer attributes like age, income, education level, and spending patterns.

⚙️ Technologies Used
	•	Python
	•	Pandas, NumPy (for data manipulation)
	•	Scikit-learn (for K-Means clustering)
	•	Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization)

🛠 Project Workflow
	1.	Data Loading: Read customer data from a CSV file.
	2.	Preprocessing: Handle missing values, drop categorical features, and normalize numerical values.
	3.	Clustering with K-Means: Apply K-Means clustering to group customers.
	4.	Analysis & Visualization:
	•	Cluster assignment for each customer.
	•	Centroid analysis to understand group characteristics.
	•	2D and 3D visualizations of clustered data.

📌 Key Findings
	•	The customers are segmented into three distinct clusters:
	1.	Affluent, Educated, and Old-Aged Customers
	2.	Middle-Aged and Middle-Income Customers
	3.	Young and Low-Income Customers
	•	Visualization techniques like scatter plots and 3D plots help interpret clusters effectively.
