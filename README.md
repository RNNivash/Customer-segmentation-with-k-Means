## 📌 **Overview**
This project applies **K-Means clustering** to segment customers based on demographic and behavioral data. Customer segmentation helps businesses understand different customer groups, improve marketing strategies, and optimize customer retention.

## 📊 **Dataset**
- The dataset used in this project is sourced from IBM Object Storage.
- It contains customer attributes like **age, income, education level, and spending patterns**.

## ⚙️ **Technologies Used**
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** (for data manipulation)
- **Scikit-learn** (for K-Means clustering)
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (for data visualization)

## 🛠 **Project Workflow**
1. **Data Loading**: Read customer data from a CSV file.
2. **Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, drop categorical features, and normalize numerical values.
3. **Clustering with K-Means**: Apply K-Means clustering to group customers.
4. **Analysis & Visualization**:
   - Cluster assignment for each customer.
   - Centroid analysis to understand group characteristics.
   - 2D and 3D visualizations of clustered data.

## 📌 **Key Findings**
- The customers are segmented into **three distinct clusters**:
  1. **Affluent, Educated, and Old-Aged Customers**
  2. **Middle-Aged and Middle-Income Customers**
  3. **Young and Low-Income Customers**
- Visualization techniques like scatter plots and 3D plots help interpret clusters effectively.
